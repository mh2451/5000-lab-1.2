About this site

# Purpose
This website is meant to help practice building a simple website using quarto, while pushing it to GU domains. It is also meant to reinforce good practices with using git as well as rsync. 

## Content
The content of this website is loosely based on some research I performed during my undergradute studies as a Nutrtional Sciences student. We were tasked on creating a chocolate product that catered to the needs of a specific demographic. 

### Plot
The following plot is just practice.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 200)
a = 1 
b = 0.5
y = a * np.exp(b * x)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(x, y, linewidth=2, color="blue")
plt.title("Python skill over time", fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel("Time", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("skill", fontsize=12)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
